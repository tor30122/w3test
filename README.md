# ðŸ‘‹ Hello developer!

This project contains a basic node express application to get you started. Check our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to learn the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). ðŸ¦„

While you're in the editor working, the site will be running `npm run dev`, which runs Nodemon, and changes to JS files or environment will restart the application. Once you close the editor, the container runs `npm run start`.

## Knowledge requirements

To be able to fully understand and modify this template to your needs, there are several things you should know (or learn):

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
- [Node.js](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp)

## Warning - environment variables

Do not change SQLITE_DB as it is generated. If you change it the space will not behave as predicted.

## ðŸ”¨ What's next?

Customize this template to make it your own.  
Remember to make your layout responsive - if you want your site to look good on smaller screens like mobile.

## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

You can find static resources in the folder `public`.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note
For now files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
